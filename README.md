# Creating an AWS EC2 Instance with Two Disks

This Terraform script creates an AWS EC2 instance with two disks: a root volume and a data volume. The instance type and key pair name are specified in `variables.tf`. The security groups for SSH and HTTP access are defined in `security_groups.tf`. 

The `userdata.sh` file initializes the instance upon launch. In this example, it simply adds a "Hello World!" message to a file.

To create the instance, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the instance is created, you can SSH into it using the key pair specified in `variables.tf`.

Example output:

```
Outputs:

instance_ip = "X.X.X.X"
```
